                When you decide to create team meetings on our platform via the Google Meet option, we would request that you grant our platform permissions that would help you create and manage your meetings seamlessly, on Google Meet.
                How we collect, store, use and manage your crucial Google permissions are carefully explained below for your understanding:
             </p>


            <p class="mt-4">
                Who is requesting for your Google user data: when you decide to create a meeting on our platform via Google Meet, we will request that you grant only Belugar access to your Google Calendar Events. This permission is only used by our platform and is never shared with any other party aside Google, for obtaining the necessary tokens needed for integrating our platform into your Google/Meet account.
               <br> These tokens are securely protected and encrypted at rest, in a way that prevents potential access from any other party aside Belugar.
               <br> What data are we requesting for: when creating team meetings on our platform via the Google Meet option, we will request you grant us access to your Google Calendar Events scope, indicated by this link "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events". This scope grants us access to read from, write to and delete events in your calendar, on your behalf.
               <br>While this may give us access to any event on your Google calendar, we herein state carefully that we're only interested in the events you added to your Google calendar via our platform; and we'll never in any way interact with any other events on your calendar that was not created via our platform.
               <br> Why we are requesting for your Google user data: we are requesting for your Calendar Events scope to grant our platform access to reading and writing events on your behalf. We will use this access granted to us to fetch events tied to your Google Meeting link, create new events tied to your Google Meet and Calendar accounts, update existing Google Meet team meetings, and delete the events whenever you decide to delete a meeting tied to your Google Meet and Calendar accounts. This helps keep you and your teams updated on the status of your meetings, to avoid teams trying to enter a meeting that no longer exists or whose date of occurrence has been changed/updated.
               <br>By granting us this access, it will be very much easier to create meetings on our platform that will also create the event on your Google calendar and return back to you the meeting link for the meeting; which you can share with anyone you intend to share with, and also, automatically to your team members whom you have added to the meeting.

            </p>

            <p class="mt-4">
                Termination of your Google user data: if at any point in time you decide to stop using meetings via Google Meet on our platform, there are three options available for you to invalidate any of your Google credentials we may be in possession of:
                <br>Method 1: this is by far the simplest.
                <br>Simply log in to your account on our platform, locate and click on the 'Disconnect Integration' button on the Integrations tab.
                <br>We have prepared a tutorial on how to add, use and remove your Google integration here Connecting Google Meet To Belugar
                <br>Method 2: simply send us a mail at hello@belugar.com with your registered email address on our platform and your request to discontinue granting our platform access to your Google/Meet account data, and we'll remove every record we have regarding your Google/Meet account data.
                <br>Method 3: simply remove our app from the list of apps you have granted access to, on your Google account, which can be found on the Security section of your Google account under Third-party apps with account access. Doing so will invalidate all records we're in possession of.

            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 capitalize">
                WE HEREIN, POINT OUT THAT BELUGAR FULLY COMPLIES WITH THE GOOGLE API SERVICES USER DATA POLICY, INCLUDING THE LIMITED USE REQUIREMENTS; AND THAT BELUGAR'S USE AND TRANSFER OF INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM GOOGLE APIS TO ANY OTHER APP WILL ADHERE TO GOOGLE API SERVICES USER DATA POLICY , INCLUDING THE LIMITED USE REQUIREMENTS.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
                Remember that after revoking our access to your Google data, you will no longer be able to use the meetings via Google Meet on our platform unless you reconnect our platform to your Google account again.
                <br>Your Choices Regarding Information
