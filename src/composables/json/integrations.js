        about:`Often times, developers do get distracted by their social media messages and apps. This is because beginning startups usually share bug fixes, 
        UI changes and other product related conversations on their choice of social media platform, as images, texts or videos.Doing this exposes developers 
        on the team to distractions (e.g other texts/DMs, WhatsApp statuses etc.) on their social media app; this becomes a problem and leads to distractions and lack of doing an honest work for the day.Therefore, with the Belugar Visual Studio Code extension, development teams can get these tasks (bug-fixes etc.) directly on their VSCode app and work on them straightaway without having to leave their workspace for a potential distraction during their work hours.This helps teams stay productive at all times when neccesary, same way the big companies in the industry are executing their operations.`
